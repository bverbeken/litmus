h1. Litmus

h4. Litmus makes it easier to test your play app.

p. First and foremost, Litmus provides you a very fluent api for your functional testing needs. You'll be able to test the rendered html and text that comes out of controller methods, the content of cookies, existence, non-existence and content of validation messages, renderArgs and more.
You'll also get a very convenient way to call your controller methods. Instead of new-ing a HashMap<String, String>(), putting all request params in it and lose precious lines of code, you can simply do @new Request("/some/path").with("param1", "value").post()@

p. Next to that, Litmus gives you a parent ValidationTest you can extend to test the validation annotations on your models. What excuse do you have left not to tests these things when you can (and only have to) write @assertThat("firstName").isRequired()@.

p. Under the hood, litmus uses the following libraries
* <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fest/">Fest-assert</a>'s fluent assertThat() API. @assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected)@ feels more natural than @assertEquals(expected, actual)@. A big plus is that this syntax allows you to chain asserts.
* <a href="http://jsoup.org">JSoup</a>'s html parser, to enable you to assert things on the rendered html.


h2. Sample application

If this documentation page is not enough, there's a <a href="http://github.com/bverbeken/litmus-samples">litmus-samples repository on github</a>.
Go and check that out for all possible examples on how to use litmus.

h2. Getting started

p. First off, you need to declare litmus as a project dependency in your @dependencies.yml@. After that, you can just start to write your first litmus tests.

h2. Usage

p. For the moment, litmus provides you with two types of tests, @litmus.functional.FunctionalTest@ and @litmus.unit.ValidationTest@.
Both have a very specific purpose.
* FunctionalTest is used to call action methods and assert things on the response such as cookies, renderArgs, the response body itself, etc.
* ValidationTest is a small utility test class to help you in writing validation tests.


h3. FunctionalTest

This is the superclass you should use for all your functional tests. Like all litmus test classes, it is a subclass of a play test class (in casu @play.test.FunctionalTest@), so you'll be able to run litmus functional tests using @auto-test@ or in the TestRunner.

p. @litmus.functional.FunctionalTest@ gives you the following:
* all fest's @assertThat(xxx)@ methods are available in a litmus functional test (though not as static methods). That way, you can write things like @assertThat(aString).isNotEmpty();@
* next to that, you get a number of custom Play-specific Assert classes, so you can write asserts on the response itself (contentType, http status code, ...), cookies, flash variables, header parameters, the html in the response body, the render arguments you passed to the view in your controller, etc.

* utility methods to easily call action methods on your controllers.

p. In general, when you're writing a functional test, you do the following:
* build a Request object
* call a http method on this Request, which results in a Response object, your 'actual'.
* assert that the actual response is conform to what you expect.

bc. Request request = new Request("/path/as/defined/in/your/routes/file");
Response response = request.get(); // or request.post(), or ...
assertThat(response).isOk();

p(note). The Response object is a Litmus class that wraps @play.mvc.Http.Response and adds some functionality to retrieve the renderArgs and stuff.

h4. Asserting the response itself

the @ResponseAssert@ class is responsible for asserting that the actual response you got from sending your request is conform to what you expect:

Asserts on http status codes

bc. assertThat(response).isStatus(200);
assertThat(response).isOk();
assertThat(response).isNotFound();
assertThat(response).isForbidden();
...
assertThat(response).isSuccess(); // status code is 200-299
assertThat(response).isError();   // status code is 400-599
assertThat(response).isRedirect();// status code is 300-399
// or you can also assert the location header:
assertThat(response).isRedirectTo("/another/path");


Asserts on headers

bc. assertThat(response).hasHeader("location");
assertThat(response).hasNoHeader("location");


Asserts on Flash Parameters

bc. assertThat(response).hasFlashParam("aKey");
// or if you want to assert its content too:
assertThat(response).hasFlashParam("aKey", "aValue");
assertThat(response).hasNoFlashParam("aKey");


Asserts on cookies

bc. assertThat(response).hasCookie("cookieName");
assertThat(response).hasCookieValue("cookieName", "cookieValue");
assertThat(response).hasNoCookie("cookieName");

Asserts on renderArgs

bc. assertThat(response).hasRenderArg("name");
assertThat(response).hasRenderArgValue("name", anObject);
assertThat(response).hasNoRenderArg("name");

Asserts on content type

bc. assertThat(response).hasContentType("text/plain");
...
// there are also some shortcut methods
assertThat(response).isHtml(); // text/html
assertThat(response).isXml();  // text/xml
assertThat(response).isJson(); // application/json
assertThat(response).isText(); // text/plain


Asserts on response encoding

bc. assertThat(response).isEncoded("utf-8");
// or shorter:
assertThat(response).isUtf8();

Assert on validation errors

bc. import static litmus.unit.validation.BuiltInValidation.REQUIRED;
...
assertThat(response).hasValidationError("firstName", REQUIRED);


h4. Asserting the Html in the response body

First, you need to get the html from the response. You can do this either by calling @.getHtml()@ on a response object, or by using a shortcut method on FunctionalTest itself.

Option 1 (which is to be preferred when you want fine-grained control over your request)

bc. Html html = new Request("/a/path")
    .with("paramName", "paramValue")
    .post()
    .getHtml();

Option 2 (much shorter when you're just GETting html)

bc. Html html = getHtml("/a/path")

Next, you'll want to assert that the resulting Html is conform to what you expect. You have several methods available:

Title assertions:

bc. assertThat(html).hasTitle("pageTitle");
assertThat(html).titleContains("geTitl");
assertThat(html).titleMatches("aRegex");

Html content assertions:

bc. assertThat(html).containsElement("#myDiv");
assertThat(html).doesNotContain("#myDiv");
assertThat(html).contains("<div id='myDiv'>This is my div!</div>");


p(note). Litmus uses <a href="http://jsoup.org">JSoup</a> behind the scenes to do the html parsing and . See the jsoup documentation for more info on the supported selector syntax.


h3. ValidationTest

ValidationTest is a superclass you can use to easily test validation annotations on your models. The idea is the following: for each test method in
the test class, you start from a valid object, then change something, validate the object and assert that a validation error has occured (or not).

p. To use it, you just
* extend it, using the class under test as a generic type
* implement the abstract @valid()@ method. This method should return an instance of the object under test that is valid.

h4. An example

bc. public class PersonValidationTest extends ValidationTest<Person> {
    @Override
    protected Person valid() {
        return new Person("Ben", "Verbeken");
    }
}

After that, you can write your test methods like this:

bc. import static litmus.unit.validation.BuiltInValidation.REQUIRED;
...
@Test
public void firstNameIsRequired() {
    assertThat("firstName").withValue("").isInvalid();
}

You can use another method, if you want to chain asserts:

bc. @Test
public void firstNameIsRequired() {
    assertThat("firstName").shouldNotBe("").shouldNotBe(null);
}


If you want to check for a specific validation error type, you can use the BuiltInValidation enum and do:

bc. import static litmus.unit.validation.BuiltInValidation.REQUIRED;
...
@Test
public void firstNameIsRequired() {
    assertThat("firstName").withValue("").isInvalidBecause(REQUIRED);
}

Finally, you can of course also test your custom validation annotations, using

bc. @Test
public void myCustomValidation() {
    assertThat(fieldName).withValue(x).isInvalidBecause("custom.msg.key");
}


p(note). ValidationTest itself also contains a test method, called @validObjectShouldValidate()@, that tests whether @valid()@ really returns a valid object.
If your implementation of @valid()@ does not return a valid object (according to the annotations you put on its fields), this test will fail.
