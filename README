play-testutils is a very simple library that allows for more expressive testing when using Play!framework.

Warning: this is a work in progress. The api is very very likely to change ;) 

For example: 

@Test
public void testThatIndexPageWorks() {
	assertThat(GET("/"))
		.isOk()
		.isHtml()	
		.isUtf8();

}

instead of 

@Test
public void testThatIndexPageWorks() {
    Response response = GET("/");
    assertIsOk(response);
    assertContentType("text/html", response);
    assertCharset(play.Play.defaultWebEncoding, response);
}
